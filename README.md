# Audit Automations

These scripts were written to make our auditor's job easier. Part of their role involves pulling multiple reports from a data system and then reviewing them for missing data, logical inconsistencies, and spurious data.

I think there's no reason for this person to have to find and flag missing and inconsistent data by hand. I wrote these scripts to turn a labor-intensive and error process into a process that takes a few seconds.

## Usage
Honestly, these scripts will be of no use to you unless you work with these exact same reports. They're here mainly for safekeeping and for anyone that's interested in reviewing.

Thanks for reviewing my repo!
